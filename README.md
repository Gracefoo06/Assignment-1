Holostars main page
Holostars is a vtuber idol group that is uprising in popularity recently, thus i am making a website for people who are curious or do not know what they are, they can look into my website. They can learn what their about, who are the talents, find their official sns, what events they have participated in and if they have any questions they can read my faq page and try to contact us.

As a user type, i want to find out more about this group so i can have a better understanding of who they are and what they are, so i added descriptions on about who they are and their official sns and events to get a better understanding

As a user type, if i want to know if i can do things such as do fan works or send gifts, i can check the FAQ page to know the possible answers to these questions, and if the answer was not answered in the FAQ page, i can send a inquirey

As a sponsor, i want to find out more about the group especially about their events, thus i put an event page, with examples, screenshots, descriptions and with media showing their events and performances, so they can take a look and consider sponsering the group

As a sponsor, if i want to contact the company, to maybe sponsor the group, ask a quiery, or even to ask for a collaboration, they can find a contact page to contact the company in this situation.
